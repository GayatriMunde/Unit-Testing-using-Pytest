What is Unit Testing ?
- Testing at the most atomic level is called UNIT TESTING
- Testing a small level of functionality, a method / function / class anything
- Testing/ Quality assurance is different, done by a separate grp but Unit Testing by the programmer itself
- Testing captures the essence of what u want to perform
- Capture specifications 
- Writing unit tests conveys the understanding of the specification by the programmer
- WHAT IS EXPECTED -> UNDERSTAND LOOKING AT UNIT tests
- Reading unit tests give a better idea of the specifications, as it is easier to understand the code and tests written
- Many tests, almost lines of code same as testing lines, 
- This is also code, but needs to be organised as well
- Many more tests to test a function
